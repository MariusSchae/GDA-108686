# **Introduction to Pandas DataFrames â€“ Replicating an article in Markdown**
---
## Pandas.ipynb

This file is an interactive, web-based document in which code, text, data, documentation, and visualizations can be combined in a meaningful way. The focus is not on writing complete and optimized programs, but rather on gradually revealing data and (interim) results.

This is why they are widely used in the fields of data science and GIS. Jupyter notebooks make research results and analyses transparent, interactive, and shareable. Markdown is used to supplement the notebooks with formatted text.

**Markdown** is used to clearly structure the texts with specific formatting instructions. Code fragments can follow or be inserted between these descriptive text passages.

## Pandas.webp

This is an image file. The format of this file is very modern and offers greater compression than, for example, the well-known JPG and PNG formats. Although the files are smaller, the image quality remains high. This makes them particularly interesting for use on the Internet, as images load faster without consuming a lot of storage space or data volume.

## Pandas.html

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is also a markup language, just like **Markdown**. It is primarily used as the basis for web pages and describes the structure of the web page or the elements that make up the web page. It is also human-readable, but not as easy to read and write quickly as text in Markdown format.
*Texts in Markdown format can be automatically converted to HTML format.*
